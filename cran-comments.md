## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs
when checked locally with --no-manual

This is my first package and this is a resubmission of this package.
I changed the title of the package to proper title case, as was requested.
Additionally, there was a NOTE that I didnt see because of NEWS.md so I
changed it to NEWS and I checked it and I got NO NOTES, ERRORS, or WARNINGS.
