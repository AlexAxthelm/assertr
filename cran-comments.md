## Test environments
* local OS X Yosemite 10.10.2 install, R 3.1.3
* ubuntu (on travis-ci), R 3.1.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs
when checked locally with --no-manual

This is my first package and this is a resubmission of this package.
The first time I didnt use the license file right, but I fixed that now.
Additionally, there was a NOTE that I didnt see because of NEWS.md so I
changed it to NEWS and I checked it and I got NO NOTES, ERRORS, or WARNINGS.
